# AID-World-Info-research-sheet
A collection of information gathered from multiple online sources on optimizing the use of world info in the artificial intelligence writing game AI Dungeon.

These documents remain here for archival purposes. There is likely no further need of updating unofficial AID documentation.
The reasons for much the community abandoning the service can be found in the linked article. All of the information gathered by the anonymous journalists is verifiable online and mostly confirmed by Latitude through their corporate communciations: https://rentry.co/remember-what-they-took-from-you  

Some of the essays posted in docs may sound strange and inaccurate to ML professionals. Keep in mind that there have been many advancements in the field within the last three years with no end in sight. Latitude at launch did not do a good job of educating users on the principles of LLMs and we had to work with the tools given to us, building up our understanding in reverse with little guidance on where to find resources for learning statistics and deep learning. User-created content and end-user understanding of LLMs has greatly increased since. If you enjoy using AI Dungeon today, great üëç
