# AID-World-Info-research-sheet
A collection of information gathered from multiple online sources on optimizing the use of world info in the artificial intelligence writing game AI Dungeon.

The valahraban research sheet and all downstream forks are now under a CLA: Currently the terms only apply to forks and their authors. If you're going to change and publicize the fork, distinguish it from the original by renaming it. Otherwise you risk your public github license getting revoked by the original author.

```
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

The above is a citation of the 1st Amendment of the US constitution. Even companies must respect the spirit of this legislation in-so-far-as activities outside the purview of the company or its editorial reach. In my view this principle and potentially other free speech related laws of US states have been breached by Latitude on April 28th of 2021 as they chose a terrible and maligned way of removing undesired content from their platform, resulting in unjustly harming many of their users and drawing the ire of ther community for their censorious acts. These acts weren't exclusively targeted against users whose content verifiably broke Latitude's TOS.

Latitude choosing a hamfisted approach to combat defamatory and potentially illegal content on their platform is entirely within their rights. The approach they chose was harmful though and something I can't support as a free-speech advocate. I will continue providing AID and writing research guidance at my own pace as I desire. But I also support anyone wishing to boycott and protest against Latitude for their mishandling of their community and terrible public relations approach.
Don't bother searching for my accounts. I use different names for each online service. How recognizable my nicknames are on chatting service I care not for.
