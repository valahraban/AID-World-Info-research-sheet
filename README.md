# AID-World-Info-research-sheet
A collection of information gathered from multiple online sources on optimizing the use of world info in the artificial intelligence writing game AI Dungeon.

The valahraban research sheet and all downstream forks are now under a CLA: Currently the terms only apply to forks and their authors. If you're going to change and publicize the fork, distinguish it from the original by renaming it. Otherwise you risk your public github license getting revoked by the original author.
