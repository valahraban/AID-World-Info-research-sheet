# AID-World-Info-research-sheet
A collection of information gathered from multiple online sources on optimizing the use of world info in the artificial intelligence writing game AI Dungeon.

These documents remain here for archival purposes. The scummy actions, the invasion of privacy, allowing the databreach to happen and damaging of individual's privacy as well as the hypocritical censorous actions of Latitude have been thoroughly demonstrated and documented by now.

As of May 17th I lost faith in the company and recommended players backup their data and delete their accounts. Without communicating any change in their TOS, Latitude had started banning scripters for trying to work with the filter. Even if you used a script to remove all occurrances of offending words, you risked getting banned. Things have only gotten worse since then. Allegedly they hired contractors from taskup.ai to vet user content. Due to their broken filter which may trip even on AI produced outputs, this eventually means all of the content.

It doesn't matter if the hires are from taskup or elsewhere, further invasion of data security rights is unacceptable. I had fun with AI Dungeon while it lasted, but I recommend people go spend their valuable time literally anywhere else than on this trashy company and the product they ruined. The documentation provided within this repository may still be of benefit to people using other GPT-family writing tools.
